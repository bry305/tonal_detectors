This work was conducted during my Ph.D. financed by the french Naval Academy (Institut de Recherche de l'Ecole Navale - Brest, France) and was also developed during my visit to the Center for Conservation Bioacoustics at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology - Cornell University, Ithaca (NY, USA).

<b> Abstract:</b> Extraction of tonal signals embedded in background noise is a crucial step before classification and separation of low-frequency sounds of baleen whales. This work reports results of comparing five tonal detectors, namely the instantaneous frequency estimator, YIN estimator, harmonic product spectrum, cost-function, and ridge detector. The comparisons, based on a low-frequency adaptation of the <i>Silbido</i> scoring feature, employ five metrics which quantify the effectiveness of these detectors to retrieve tonal signals having a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNRs) and the quality of the detection results. Ground-truth data were generated by embedding 10 synthetic Antarctic blue whale (<i>Balaenoptera musculus intermedia</i>) calls in randomly-extracted 30-minute noise segments from a 79~h-library recorded by an Ocean Bottom Seismometer (OBS) in the Indian Ocean during 2012-2013. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed using 20 trials per SNR, ranging from 0 dB to 15 dB. Overall, the obtained tonal detection results show the superiority of the cost-function and the ridge detectors, over the other detectors, for all SNR values. More particularly, for lower SNRs (≤ 3 dB), these two methods outperformed the other three with high recall, low fragmentation, and high coverage scores. For SNRs ≥ 7 dB, the five methods performed similarly.
